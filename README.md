Description

This project aims at building an online video game store. The store is going to feature many different types of games that users can purchase. It will feature a search function for users to go through the library of the store via name, genre, price, or platform. It will feature a discount system that will have different codes available for buyers to use based on the given day of the week. Certain games will be recommended based on the day of the week. Games will have a review score that the user can check before buying. The user will be able to use the different search functions to add items to a cart that they can check out and get a total purchase number.

Specification

A menu of options will be presented to the user that will allow them to choose what they’d like to do in the store. The search functions will take parameters and return games that match those search parameters. The discount code function will take a code from the user and use it to discount the price of the game. There will also be a function that will return a recommended game for that day of the week. Lastly, the store will also have a function to take a user’s review of a game and add that into the game’s existing review average and a rewards system that will give the user a certain amount of points for money spent. All of these functions will be called within the main function and defined outside it.
